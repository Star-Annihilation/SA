Team Color Hex Code for Bucket or Team Color recognition is 830083.
Add that color to a brush or a bucket and change the color of anything to that for absolute team color.
If you want to add reflection youll need to flatten the layers together then add transparencies.
Also Blurred edges that change the hexcode 830083 will cause purple edges around, so disable anti aliasing on your edits to disable bluring render effect.
Will better document later...

To recreate talonlogogouraud, take file blanklogogouraud and remove transparency. Add Talonraw64 as a new layer ontop. Merge both layers together, then you can add a universal transparency of -60 to have a consistent reflection throughout the texture to have a mild shiny.

I was using Paint.net 4.2.1 with boltbaits plugins. This allows you to remove transpariencies from layers by ADJUSTMENTS tab with transpariences. 
Then you can add the transpariency back later after merging the layers.

So try selecting a texture of your preference and add talonraw32 as a layer ontop of texture at size 64x64 recommended, and saving it, and try adding the teamtex
document and see if it works


I can add the logo to any 64x64 texture of your choice you can put that file in the above folder
